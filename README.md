Computer Networks: CS428

Create an IRC-like chat room that supports multiple clients and one server
The chat does not need to forward messages from each client, to every other client,
but only to the server

Instructions:
gcc server.c -o s.out
gcc client.c -o c.out
./s.out <ip_address>
./c.out <ip_address>

Competion status:
Has been tested running on same computer with a private ip address
and works, I do not have two computers to test with. But I assume
it works when inputting proper IP addresses

THANKS :D
